# Income-prediction-on-Census

This report is based on the Adult (Census Income) dataset, which was extracted by Ronny Kohavi and Barry Becker from the 1994 Census bureau database. The dataset contains the demographic features of each adult sample, including their age, work class, occupation, marital status, education level, etc.

The main objective of this report is to predict the annual income of individuals based on their demographic features. The purpose is to explore **what factors affect a personâ€™s income level** and build reliable models to classify individuals into two categories: those who earn less than 50,000 per year and those who earn more than 50,000 per year.

There are 15 variables. For dimensionality, we applied the L1- regularized logistic regression, the PCA (Principal Component Analysis), SVD (Singular Value Decomposition)and Random Forest. To improve prediction, we further applied decision tree and Artificial Neural Networks on our selected variables.
